## Testing Procedure

For each test scenario:

1. **Project Setup**: Enter all parameters as specified
2. **Excel Upload**: Upload the corresponding Excel files
3. **Analysis Modules**: Run all analysis modules
4. **Claude AI Validation**: Validate results with Claude AI (if API key available)
5. **Report Generation**: Generate PDF reports
6. **Verification**: Check that all calculations are correct and reports are generated properly

## Expected Outcomes

- All scenarios should complete without errors
