- Verified functional accuracy through testing

### 2. Deployment Optimization ✅
- Confirmed compatibility with Streamlit deployment platform
- Optimized repository structure for cleaner deployment
- Created proper configuration files (.streamlit/config.toml)

### 3. Performance and Efficiency Improvements ✅
- Implemented memory and cache optimization through [.gitignore](file:///C:/Users/Rajkumar/Bridge_Slab_Design2/.gitignore)
- Removed redundant files to streamline the repository
- Made the program one-click usable with clear instructions

### 4. Testing ✅
- Created unit tests for core functionality ([test_excel_processor.py](file:///C:/Users/Rajkumar/Bridge_Slab_Design2/test_excel_processor.py))
- Verified Excel processing module functionality
- Provided framework for additional tests

### 5. Feature Suggestions ✅
- Added caching mechanisms through proper file management
